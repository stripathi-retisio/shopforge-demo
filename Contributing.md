# CONTRIBUTING.md

First off — thank you for considering contributing! ShopForge is a learning-friendly project and welcomes contributions of all kinds, from bug fixes to new features to documentation improvements.

---

## Ways to Contribute

- 🐛 **Bug reports** — something broken? File an issue
- 💡 **Feature suggestions** — have an idea? Open a discussion
- 🔧 **Code contributions** — fix a bug or build something new
- 📝 **Documentation** — improve any of the docs
- 🎨 **Design** — better UI, new themes, accessibility improvements

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
# Fork via GitHub UI, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shopforge-demo.git
cd shopforge-demo
```

### 2. Open the project

No build step needed — just open the file:

```bash
open index.html
# or drag it into your browser
```

For a better dev experience, use a local server to avoid localStorage quirks:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Node (npx)
npx serve .

# VS Code
# Install "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live"
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/shopforge.html`.

### 3. Make your changes

All application code lives in `shopforge.html`. See [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) for a full walkthrough of the codebase.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use `const` / `let` — never `var`
- Arrow functions for callbacks
- Template literals for HTML strings
- Descriptive variable names — `tenantId` not `tid`
- Follow the existing `render*() / attach*()` pattern for new views
- CSS: add new design tokens to `:root` rather than hardcoding values inline

### HTML / CSS

- New components should use existing CSS variables (`--brand`, `--surface`, etc.)
- Don't add new external font or library dependencies without discussion
- Maintain the existing dark-theme-first aesthetic

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
feat: add product variant support
fix: cart qty not updating on remove
docs: update DB schema in DESIGN.md
style: improve mobile layout for dashboard
refactor: extract cart logic into separate module
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits

3. **Test manually:**
   - [ ] Merchant signup flow works end-to-end
   - [ ] Products can be added, edited, deleted
   - [ ] Orders appear in dashboard after storefront checkout
   - [ ] Admin dashboard shows correct data
   - [ ] No `console.error` in the browser console
   - [ ] Works in Chrome and Firefox

4. **Open a PR** against `main` with:
   - A clear title and description of what changed and why
   - Screenshots or a screen recording if UI changed
   - Reference any related issue with `Closes #123`

5. A maintainer will review within a few days
